# World Energy Visualization

## Motivation and Purpose

Role:  
Target:  

As the world...  

## Dataset Description

In this dashboard, we will be visualizing the [Renewable vs Nuclear Energy generation](https://www.kaggle.com/donjoeml/energy-consumption-and-generation-in-the-globe) dataset. The dataset contains 4 csv files, which illustrated the proportion of energy source of eletricity production and consumption for each country from 1965 to 2019, as well as highlighted the type and capacity of energy production from every power plants in the world. In the three csv files describing percentage of energy type for power consumption/production, we have columns stating the country or region (`Entity`, `Code`), year of record (`Year`), and the percentage values (indicated by `(% sub energy)` and `(% electricity)`). Meanwhile for the power plant data, apart from the country and year, we would also want to carry out visualization on its production capacity (`capacity_mw`) and its type of energy source (`primary fuel`). 

With the dataset, we will be visualizing the percentage of energy consumption/production by broad types (`Fossil Fuels`, `Renewables`, `Nuclear`) and sub-types (`Coal`, `Gas`, `Hydro`, `Solar`, `Wind`, `Oil`, `Nuclear`) in each country. The number and total capacity of power plants in each country by their primary energy type would also be calculated and rendered as one of the numeric attributes available for users to select.
