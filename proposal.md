# World Energy Visualization

## Motivation and Purpose

Role:  
Target:  

As the world...  

## Dataset Description

In this dashboard, we will be visualizing the [Renewable vs Nuclear Energy generation](https://www.kaggle.com/donjoeml/energy-consumption-and-generation-in-the-globe) dataset. The dataset contains 4 csv files, which illustrated the proportion of energy source of eletricity production and consumption for each country starting from 1965, as well as highlighted the type and capacity of energy production from every power plants in the world.

With the dataset, we will be visualizing the percentage of energy consumption/production by broad types (`Fossil Fuels`, `Renewables`, `Nuclear`) and sub-types (`Coal`, `Gas`, `Hydro`, `Solar`, `Wind`, `Oil`, `Nuclear`) in each country. The number and total capacity of power plants in each country by their primary energy type would also be calculated and rendered as one of the numeric attributes available for users to select.
