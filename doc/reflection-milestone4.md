# Reflection of milestone 4

## Has it been easy to use your app?

- According to the peer feedback, the dashboard is easy to use in general. We tried to make our application as straightforward as possible with short descriptions.
- To have a better user experience, we added toggle buttons for descriptions to simplify the interface while information is still accessible if needed.
- We believe the two tabs by two categories - `Global Distribution` and `Historical Trends`- would conveniently help users locate the desired information and prevent being overwhelmed by charts and plots.

## What differences are there between the DashR and DashPy app?

## Are there reoccurring themes in your feedback on what is good and what can be improved?

## Is there any feedback (or other insight) that you have found particularly valuable during your dashboard development?
